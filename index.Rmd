Hi, I'm Pierre. I'm a Belgian environmental economist with a passion for sustainability, data science and everything in between!

I've dedicated the first years of my young career working for international institutions (EIB, FAO) and improving my data analysis and visualization skills, among other things. Check out the Project tab of this site if you want to check out some of my stuff.
